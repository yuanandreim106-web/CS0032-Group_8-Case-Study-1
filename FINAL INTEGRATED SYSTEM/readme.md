## Project Overview

This case study examines a PHP-based customer segmentation dashboard application that demonstrates data-driven marketing analytics. The application provides business intelligence through multiple customer segmentation strategies and includes a pure PHP implementation of k-means clustering algorithm for advanced customer profiling.

**Key Technologies:**

- Backend: PHP 7+, PDO for database access
- Database: MySQL
- Frontend: HTML5, Bootstrap 5.3, JavaScript
- Data Visualization: Chart.js
- Server: XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)

**Core Features:**

1. Session-based authentication system
2. Seven customer segmentation types (Gender, Region, Age Group, Income Bracket, Purchase Tier, ML Clusters, CLV Tiers)
3. Interactive data visualizations (bar charts, line charts, pie charts, radar charts, scatter plots)
4. Export functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF formats)
5. RESTful API for external integrations
6. Advanced CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) segmentation
7. Pure PHP k-means clustering implementation
8. Automated business insights generation
9. Marketing recommendations based on cluster analysis

### CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) Implementation

**CLV Formula:**

```
CLV = purchase_amount × purchase_frequency × (customer_lifespan_months ÷ 12)
```

**Percentile-Based Tier Segmentation:**

- **Bronze**: Bottom 40% of customers by CLV
- **Silver**: 40th-70th percentile
- **Gold**: 70th-90th percentile
- **Platinum**: Top 10% of customers

**Implementation Details:**

- CLV calculation uses realistic defaults: frequency = 2.5 purchases/month, lifespan = 36 months
- Percentiles are calculated dynamically from actual customer data distribution
- No hard-coded CLV thresholds - adapts to data characteristics
- PHP-based percentile calculation ensures academic evaluation suitability

**Business Insights:**

- Revenue concentration analysis across tiers
- Customer migration strategies
- Targeted retention campaigns for high-CLV segments

4. Select desired columns
5. Download the exported file

### 7.2 Advanced Segmentation - CLV Tiers

**Business Logic:**
CLV = (Average Purchase Amount × Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan)

**Default Parameters:**
- Purchase Frequency: 2.5 purchases per month
- Customer Lifespan: 36 months (3 years)

**Tier Classification (Fixed Thresholds):**
- **Bronze**: CLV < $10,000
- **Silver**: CLV $10,000 - $24,999
- **Gold**: CLV $25,000 - $49,999
- **Platinum**: CLV ≥ $50,000

**Implementation Details:**
- Dynamic CLV calculation in SQL queries using realistic default values
- Tier assignment based on calculated CLV values
- Proper distribution across all tiers with meaningful differences
- Business insights that accurately reflect CLV segmentation results
- Export functionality includes CLV averages and tier breakdowns

**Example CLV Calculations:**
- Customer with $2,000 avg purchase: CLV = $2,000 × 2.5 × 3 = $15,000 (Silver)
- Customer with $4,000 avg purchase: CLV = $4,000 × 2.5 × 3 = $30,000 (Gold)
- Customer with $5,000 avg purchase: CLV = $5,000 × 2.5 × 3 = $37,500 (Gold)
- Customer with $6,000 avg purchase: CLV = $6,000 × 2.5 × 3 = $45,000 (Gold)

   - MySQL 5.7+
   - Apache/Nginx web server
   - Optional: Composer for advanced PDF/Excel libraries

3. **Configuration:**
   - Update database credentials in `db.php`
   - Configure API keys in `api.php` for production use

## Testing

### Unit Testing

- PHPUnit framework recommended
- Test critical functions: `normalizeData()`, `euclideanDistance()`, `initializeCentroids()`
- Mock external dependencies for isolated testing

### Integration Testing

- Test login → segmentation → logout workflow
- Verify chart rendering and data accuracy
- Test export functionality end-to-end

### API Testing

- Use tools like Postman or curl for API endpoint testing
- Verify authentication and rate limiting
- Test error handling and edge cases

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use prepared statements for all database queries
- Store API secrets securely (environment variables)
- Implement HTTPS in production
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

```

**Good luck, and happy coding!**
